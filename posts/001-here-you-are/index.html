        <p>Hi, there.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re reading this that means that you&rsquo;ve ended up in my personal blog. Welcome! I&rsquo;ll try to keep it short and interesting for both of us.</p>
<p>In the past few years, I&rsquo;ve got fascinated by the topic of pure functional programming. I was lucky enough to see it being applied in real-world projects, I learned a lot from people practising it at their everyday work. And today, I believe I grasped enough knowledge on this topic for me to share it with you as a series of educative blog posts.</p>
<p>A little bit about myself and my programming background. I write an enterprise production code in Java for most of my career. I started young with Java 1.3 in my very first project. We used a lot of XML files back then for almost everything (even UI markup). In 2013 I learned about the new language being released for the JVM called Scala. I passed an <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1?specialization=scala">obligatory coursera course</a> back then which really helped me started in functional programming concepts but didn&rsquo;t give enough insights into what makes Scala so great. So I give up on it for the next few years and only recently rediscovered it again. As a result of my experience, most of the examples in my blog will probably be in Java or Scala.</p>
<p>I must say, pure functional programming can be a controversial topic, depending on people you talk about it with. Myself, I&rsquo;m open to diverse opinions on the subject, as long as they are fair and constructive. I think it will be fun.</p>
