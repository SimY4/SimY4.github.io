      <description>There’s this saying that you shouldn’t have String as your function input unless you expect three volumes of War and Peace as valid input. So unless it’s your case and you want to improve your codebase to be more precise in type signatures, I invite you to discuss one possible option. I’ll use the following API as our case study:
interface EmailSender { void sendEmail(String from, String to, String subject, String body); } there’s an obvious ambiguity in the type signature here.</description>

      <description>Hi, there.
If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this that means that you&amp;rsquo;ve ended up in my personal blog. Welcome! I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep it short and interesting for both of us.
In the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve got fascinated by the topic of pure functional programming. I was lucky enough to see it being applied in real-world projects, I learned a lot from people practising it at their everyday work. And today, I believe I grasped enough knowledge on this topic for me to share it with you as a series of educative blog posts.</description>
