      <description>Hi, there.
If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this that means that you&amp;rsquo;ve ended up in my personal blog. Welcome! I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep it short and interesting for both of us.
In the past few years, I&amp;rsquo;ve got fascinated by the topic of pure functional programming. I was lucky enough to see it being applied in real-world projects, I learned a lot from people practising it at their everyday work. And today, I believe I grasped enough knowledge on this topic for me to share it with you as a series of educative blog posts.</description>
