      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to start new series of blogs called “We Began to Forget”. The idea is simple and a little melancholic.&#xA;Software engineering has a short memory, patterns get discovered and then forgotten, lessons get relearned.&#xA;These posts are small memory refreshers about important aspects of our craft with a strong focus on clever hacks&#xA;rather than things you can read in clever books. Books will make sure the good patterns will live on,&#xA;but tribal knowledge has to be passed by word of mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
